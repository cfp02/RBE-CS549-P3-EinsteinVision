\section{Reflection}

Our team put in many hours of work into this project, and most of that time was spent attempting to get techniques described in literature to run on our data, or even run at all. We found many powerful techinques, all with source code available, but despite this could not manage to get things actually working in time for the deadlines. This was in part due to time constraints within the group, but also due to the nebulous nature of the project. In previous projects, the goals were very clear, and the techniques could be \emph{fully} understood by our team, and thus knew when we were on the right track or not. With this project in contrast, our team found it hard to judge whether pursuing any given techinque was worth our time, and thus found it hard to make progress, as we wanted to avoid commiting to a techinque which would not work.

As a result of this, while our team spent considerable time working on this project, it felt like the only way of getting better results was simply dedicating more time to the tedious task of debugging outdated python dependencies. 

Our team also experienced a lot of fatigue when working on the project, especially in comparison to the previous projects in this course, as we did not feel as though we were learning anything or making progress as we spent dozens of hours struggling to perform inference using techniques we discovered. We didn't feel we had the time implement our own techniques, but also felt as though we were not learning anything by trying to get other people's techniques to work. Since this goal of this project was focused on "good" output, it made it stressful to prioritize different tasks, short of simply putting more time into everything, as there was no guaruntee that any given pathway was worthwhile. This was a very frustrating experience for our team. This in turn made it harder to justify taking more than dozens of hours each week we spent on the project, as it felt as though we could have spent many more dozens of hours without making any progress, or learning anything new.
